Log4rpg - A powerful logging service for RPG on System i

Debugging an application can be a very time consuming task. In particular this is true for applications that are made of small and smallest procedures and when the programmer does not know exactly where the error happens. For every procedure he has to decide whether to step over or step into it. Lots of debugging minutes can get lost because of a little mistake due to low concentration.

Inserting log statements into the code can ease the programmer’s life. The log reflects the program flow and lets the programmer know what happens. Hence it often is easier to locate the area where the bug sits.
That is what Log4rpg is made for. Log4rpg is a powerful logger that was inspired by the great LOG4J for Java. Like LOG4J it supports:

•	A logger hierarchy

•	Pluggable appenders

•	Pluggable Layouts

With Log4rpg it is possible to enable and disable logging just by modifying a configuration file. There is no need for changing code and compiling the program.
